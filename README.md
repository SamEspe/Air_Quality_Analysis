# Air_Quality_Analysis
## Contributor: Sam Espe

### Overview
This is a self-directed project investigating trends in air quality measurements over time.

### Data Source
The data is gathered from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/download-daily-data). 

### Project Structure
There is `Data` folder that contains the raw data files. The Jupyter Notebook file contains data exploration and cleaning processes. As the project progresses, I plan on creating visualizations of the data using Tableau (or similar software) and/or a Leaflet map.My project scope is currently the state of Minnesota, but I plan on expanding to the entire United States once I have established a data processing procedure.
